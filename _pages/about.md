I am a second-year Mechanical Engineering M.Sc. student at Isfahan University of Technology (IUT). I am really enthusiastic about Robotics, Machine Learning, and Game Development.

To check the various projects I have carried out please visit my [portfolio page](https://abarekatain.github.io/portfolio/)

I am currently working in the context of Cloud Robotics, where I am doing research on collaborative mapping of an unknown environment using multi-robot systems.
